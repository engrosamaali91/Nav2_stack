#install cartographer
```
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cartographer 
```

#in order to make a map i am using cartographer, not gmapping

for that i added launch and config directory in navigation package folder 

#launch gazebo 
```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
```
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```


#run rviz2
In seperate terminal open rviz2 
```
rviz2
```
and add the map to the fixed frame 
Add Odometry and set the topic to ```/odom``` and Add Map and set the topic to ```/map```


# Run launch file for cartographer

```
ros2 launch navigation mapping.launch.py
```
#save the map in config direcotry while rviz is opened. note tb3_map is just the name of the map

```
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f tb3_map
```
This will generate two file one with .pgm extension and the other with .yaml extension
